The storyline follows a platoon of U.S. Marines through their training, primarily focusing on two privates, 
Joker and Pyle, who struggle to get through boot camp under their abusive drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
and the experiences of two of the platoon's Marines in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War.
The film's title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by soldiers.
The film was released in the United States on June 26, 1987.
It was the last of Kubrick's films to be released during his lifetime.
